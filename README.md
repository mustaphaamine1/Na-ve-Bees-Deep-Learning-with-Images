# Na-ve-Bees-Deep-Learning-with-Images
## Project Description

Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this project, you will build a simple deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees, then load a pre-trained model for evaluation. You will use keras, scikit-learn, scikit-image, and numpy, among other popular Python libraries.

This serie of projects walks through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.
